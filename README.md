# Image Comparison Tool
A simple visulization tool that visualizes images with same name in different folders. 

I need to show some superior images in my paper. 
However, comparing images one by one or opening several windows at the same time is pretty troublesome.
So I wrote this tool that can check several folders at the same time, while switching images only need to press left or right button.
Hope this can help you write your paper.
Any suggestion or improvement is welcome.

Usage:  
1. Run `main.py`  
2. Set the number of folders in the menuscript (default 4, max 15). Theoretically, there is no restriction of the number of folders. However, if it larger than or equal with 16, the window will be too large to operate.  
3. Load Image folders (**This first folder is considered as the main folder**)  
4. Press '←' or '→' can move to previous or next image  
5. Click one of the shown images can draw yellow points in all subfigure  
6. Press 'S' to save current images, settings are locate in the main menu, including save path, rename image and convert to eps file.
