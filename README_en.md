[中文版使用说明](https://github.com/moothes/Image_Comparison_Tool/blob/master/readme.md)  

This tool is developed to compare different results on the same dataset.

How to use:  
----
* The first item in menu bar is the setting window. It looks like：  
![](https://github.com/moothes/Image_Comparison_Tool/blob/master/setting.PNG)  
"Folders": Number of folders as N rows and M columns；  
"Save_path": Image save path；  
"Rename": Renaming the saved images follows 1,2,3... order;  
"eps": Convert the saved images to '.eps'.
* After settings, the main page looks like：  
![](https://github.com/moothes/Image_Comparison_Tool/blob/master/main.PNG)  
The "set" button on the top right corner of each grid is used to set the folder path; 
The image list shows the image files in the first folder, so it **must** be set firstly;   
"Left" or "Right" button on the keyboard can control the previous or next image;  
"S" button can save the current image;  
You can draw on any image, while is will show on the same position of other images too.  

**Warning**
It is recommend to named the folder using the method’s name, otherwise the save results may be wrong.
Image names in different folders should be the same.

Recommended folder structure：
----
* Folder
  * method 1
    * img_1.jpg
    * img_2.jpg 
    * ...
    * img_n.jpg 
  * method 2
    * img_1.png
    * img_2.png 
    * ...
    * img_n.png 
  * ...
